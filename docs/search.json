Each dot is a core (colored by site) and panels display Shannon diversity (H′), species richness (S), and Pielou evenness (J′). Cores from area H generally sit higher for H′ and S, with less separation for J′.\nBayesian comparisons (reported as H–L) supported these patterns. Shannon diversity was higher in site H, with a mean difference of +0.365 (95% CrI [0.155, 0.579]) and a posterior probability of \\(P(H\\!-\\!L&gt;0)=1.00\\). Very little posterior mass fell within a ±0.10 region of practical equivalence (ROPE), indicating that the increase was both statistically credible and ecologically meaningful. Species richness was also greater in H, with an average difference of +1.23 species per core (95% CrI [0.17, 2.31], \\(P&gt;0=0.988\\)). Approximately one-third of the posterior distribution lay within a ±1 species ROPE, suggesting a positive but modest gain in richness. In contrast, evenness showed only a small and uncertain difference +0.116 (95% CrI [−0.020, 0.247], \\(P&gt;0=0.956\\)), with ~15% of the posterior mass within a ±0.05 ROPE.\nOverall, area H hosts richer and more diverse bivalve assemblages than area L, while evenness is at most slightly higher in H and may be similar between areas."

Overall, bivalve density tends to be higher in site H compared to site L for a given seagrass biomass. In site H, values are more scattered, with several cores exceeding 700 individuals per m², whereas site L shows consistently lower densities, generally below 500 individuals per m². Both sites display a positive, though weak, association between biomass and bivalve density, as indicated by the fitted regression lines, but the wide confidence bands highlight considerable variability. This suggests that while higher seagrass biomass may provide more habitat structure and support larger bivalve populations, other local factors likely contribute to the observed heterogeneity."

    "text": "Relationship between bivalve abundance and seagrass biomass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Density of bivalves in relation with the total biomass of seagrass (sum of above ground and below ground biomass) for site H and L.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11 illustrates the relationship between bivalve density (individuals per m²) and total seagrass biomass (above- and below-ground combined). Overall, bivalve density tends to be higher in site H compared to site L for a given seagrass biomass. In site H, values are more scattered, with several cores exceeding 700 individuals per m², whereas site L shows consistently lower densities, generally below 500 individuals per m². Both sites display a positive, though weak, association between biomass and bivalve density, as indicated by the fitted regression lines, but the wide confidence bands highlight considerable variability. This suggests that while higher seagrass biomass may provide more habitat structure and support larger bivalve populations, other local factors likely contribute to the observed heterogeneity."

Overall, no clear association was observed between these two variables, suggesting that bivalve diversity is primarily influenced by other environmental factors rather than seagrass biomass. The only exception was species richness in site L, where a weak positive relationship was apparent: cores with higher seagrass biomass tended to host a greater number of bivalve species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Diversity indices of bivalves in relation with the total biomass of seagrass (sum of above ground and below ground biomass) for site H and L."

Median densities were higher at site H (≈85 ind./m²) than at site L (0 ind./m²), with broader variability observed in H. The Kruskal–Wallis test confirmed a significant difference between sites (\\(\\chi^2=9.83\\), \\(p&lt;0.05\\)), indicating that L. orbiculatus was substantially more abundant in H than in L.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Density of Loripes orbiculatus depending on the site were it was sampled.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14 illustrates the relationship between Loripes orbiculatus density and total seagrass biomass (above- and below-ground combined). Across all samples, a moderate positive correlation was detected (Spearman ρ = 0.501, p &lt; 0.001, n = 59). At the site level, patterns differed: in site H, Loripes density increased significantly with seagrass biomass (ρ = 0.555, p = 0.0015; slope = 0.531), whereas in site L, the relationship was weaker and not statistically significant (ρ = 0.264, p = 0.175; slope = 0.247).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Density of Loripes orbiculatus depending on the total biomass of seagrass.\n\n\n\n\nTaken together, these results indicate that L. orbiculatus is both more abundant and more closely associated with seagrass biomass in site H, where meadows have maintained consistently high cover over the past 40 years. In contrast, at site L, where seagrass cover has been more variable through time, Loripes populations remain sparse and show no clear link with biomass. This suggests that long-term meadow stability may be a key factor supporting dense and persistent L. orbiculatus populations."
