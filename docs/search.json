    "text": "About the reflectance anomaly around 760 nm.\nAn unexpected reflectance feature can be observed around 761 nm in most of the spectra (Figure 3). This feature appears as a positive anomaly in some cases, such as H_04 or H_03, or as a negative anomaly, as in H_02 or H_19. The most likely explanation is an instrumental artifact, for example related to calibration issues of the ASD spectroradiometer. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that at 761 nm vegetation can also produce a narrow reflectance peak due to sunlight-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). This fluorescence signal arises from the broad chlorophyll a emission around 740 nm that partly fills the atmospheric O₂ absorption band, and has been documented both in terrestrial and aquatic vegetation (Lu et al. 2016, Meroni & Colombo, 2006).\nTo investigate the origin of this feature, the Fluorescence Line Height (FLH;Lu et al. 2016) will be calculated.\n\\[\n\\mathrm{FLH}(761)\n= R_{rs}(761)\n- \\left[\n\\frac{769-761}{769-757}\n\\big(R_{rs}(757)-R_{rs}(769)\\big)\n+ R_{rs}(769)\n\\right]\n\\]\nThe FLH values will be compared with NDVI, as proxy of the biomass, with the green leaf index proxy of the greeness of seagrass leaves as well as with the amount of time the ASD had been operating at the moment of spectrum acquisition.\nFigure 4 is showing the ralationship between the FLH, measuring the height of the peak visible at 761 nm, and the NDVI and the GLI. No relationship between the size of the anomaly and those radiometric indices can been seen from the data acquired on site H. No matter the biomass, and no matter the greenness of leaves, the peak at 761 nm can be more or less pronounced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Relationship between the Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and radiometric indices. The Normalised difference vegetation index is a proxy of the biomass while the Green Leaf Index is a proxy of leaves greenness.\n\n\n\n\nTo estimate, for each spectrum, how long the instrument had been running at the time of acquisition, we extracted the capture time of the corresponding photo-quadrat from the images’ EXIF metadata. Because the photo-quadrats were taken a few minutes before the hyperspectral measurements, their timestamps provide a close proxy for the acquisition time; aligning these timestamps with the instrument start time yields the elapsed operating time for each spectrum. Sample H_01 was acquired first. By convention, we set its instrument run time to 0 (min), and the run time for all subsequent samples is expressed relative to H_01—that is, as the difference between each sample’s acquisition timestamp and that of H_01.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Relationship between the Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and the amount of time the ASD Specfield Handheld 2 has been running.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 shows the relationship between ASD run time and the fluorescence line height at 761 nm (FLH). Sample H_01 was acquired immediately after startup (T0), and the last sample in the sequence, H_08, was collected 7,316 s (≈ 122 min) after T0. A negative linear trend can be seen (grey 95% CI shown): FLH values are highest at the beginning of the session and decline as the instrument continues to run, with several late measurements approaching zero or slightly negative values."

NDRE is analogous to NDVI but replaces the red band (~665 nm) with a red-edge band (typically ~705 nm): The advantage is reduced saturation at high biomass. Around 665 nm, chlorophyll-a absorption quickly reaches an asymptote, so reflectance in the red band changes little as biomass increases and NDVI tends to plateau. In the red-edge region, however, reflectance remains sensitive: as biomass/chlorophyll increases, reflectance near ~705 nm continues to decrease (with a concomitant shift of the red-edge to longer wavelengths). Consequently, NDRE preserves sensitivity in dense canopies and correlates more strongly with biomass than NDVI, resulting with an R² square slightly higher than for the NDVI (R²_NDVI = 0.65, R²_NDRE = 0.67)… -_-’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Relationship between the NDRE, the NDVI and the dry weight of seagrasses measured in area H"
