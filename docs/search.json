It can serve as a reference or correction for the student’s assignment.\n\nStudy area & Field data acquisition\nA field campaign was organized with Master’s students from the ACES and EBM programs. It took place in the seagrass meadow of Bourgneuf Bay, near the town of Barbâtre on Noirmoutier Island (Figure 1), on September 9th during low tide. The campaign had a dual purpose: to introduce students to the ecosystem and to collect a total of 60 sediment cores, sampling the top 15–20 cm of the substrate. Two sites were selected for coring. A historical analysis of the meadow over the past 40 years was carried out to identify areas with the most consistent and the most variable seagrass cover. Based on this analysis, site L was chosen in a zone that has shown strong variability in seagrass cover, while site H was located in an area with consistently high seagrass density over the same period.\nAt both sites, sampling locations were chosen to represent a range of seagrass percent cover. At each station, a photo-quadrat was taken using a 0.25 m² quadrat to estimate seagrass cover. Sediment cores were then collected using a 15 cm diameter PVC tube. Each core was cleaned to remove sediment, retaining only seagrass leaves and rhizomes as well as bivalves.\nBack in the lab, each sample was sorted to separate leaves (above-ground biomass) from rhizomes (below-ground biomass). Both fractions were then dried at 60 °C for 48 hours, after which they were weighed for each sampling station.\nIn order to convert the biomass of the core to a biomass in m² A conversion factor has been applied to each biomass measurements :\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nBiomass_{m^{2}} &= \\frac{100 \\times 100}{Core_{Area}} \\times Biomass_{Core} \\\\[6pt]\nCore_{Area} &= \\pi \\times \\left(\\tfrac{15}{2}\\right)^{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Map of Bourgneuf Bay Sampling site\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of NDVI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Map of NDVI of the meadow of Bourgneuf Bay\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 is showing the NDVI over the meadow. Overall the NDVI of non-water pixel is 0.32 with a maximum of 0.68. The average of NDVI over the meadow is particularly low in 2025, and is among the lowest values recorded in September since the start of the remote sensing acquisitions in the 1970’s.\n\n\nBiomass vs NDVI\nOnly in Zone H, before coring, a hyperspectral signature of the sample was taken using an ASD Fieldspec HandHeld 2. The instrument was calibrated in the field for reflectance acquisition using a Spectralon with a 99% reflective Lambertian surface (No radiance measurement has been done). Figure 3 shows that a range of biomass was sampled during the field campaign, with H_04 having the least absorption in the red, indicating a low amount of chlorophyll-a, and H_08 showing the greatest absorption in the red part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Relationship between the NDVI and the above ground biomass of seagrasses sampled in site H.

    "text": "About the reflectance anomaly around 760 nm.\nAn unexpected reflectance feature can be observed around 761 nm in most of the spectra (Figure 3). This feature appears as a positive anomaly in some cases, such as H_04 or H_03, or as a negative anomaly, as in H_02 or H_19. The most likely explanation is an instrumental artifact, for example related to calibration issues of the ASD spectroradiometer. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that at 761 nm vegetation can also produce a narrow reflectance peak due to sunlight-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). This fluorescence signal arises from the broad chlorophyll a emission around 740 nm that partly fills the atmospheric O₂ absorption band, and has been documented both in terrestrial and aquatic vegetation (Lu et al. 2016, Meroni & Colombo, 2006).\nTo investigate the origin of this feature, the Fluorescence Line Height (FLH;Lu et al. 2016) will be calculated.\n\\[\n\\mathrm{FLH}(761)\n= R_{rs}(761)\n- \\left[\n\\frac{769-761}{769-757}\n\\big(R_{rs}(757)-R_{rs}(769)\\big)\n+ R_{rs}(769)\n\\right]\n\\]\nThe FLH values will be compared with NDVI, as proxy of the biomass, with the green leaf index proxy of the greeness of seagrass leaves as well as with the amount of time the ASD had been operating at the moment of spectrum acquisition.\nFigure 4 is showing the ralationship between the FLH, measuring the height of the peak visible at 761 nm, and the NDVI and the GLI. No relationship between the size of the anomaly and those radiometric indices can been seen from the data acquired on site H. No matter the biomass, and no matter the greenness of leaves, the peak at 761 nm can be more or less pronounced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Relationship between the Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and radiometric indices. The Normalised difference vegetation index is a proxy of the biomass while the Green Leaf Index is a proxy of leaves greenness.\n\n\n\n\nTo estimate, for each spectrum, how long the instrument had been running at the time of acquisition, we extracted the capture time of the corresponding photo-quadrat from the images’ EXIF metadata. Because the photo-quadrats were taken a few minutes before the hyperspectral measurements, their timestamps provide a close proxy for the acquisition time; aligning these timestamps with the instrument start time yields the elapsed operating time for each spectrum. Sample H_01 was acquired first. By convention, we set its instrument run time to 0 (min), and the run time for all subsequent samples is expressed relative to H_01—that is, as the difference between each sample’s acquisition timestamp and that of H_01.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Relationship between the Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and the amount of time the ASD Specfield Handheld 2 has been running.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 shows the relationship between ASD run time and the fluorescence line height at 761 nm (FLH). Sample H_01 was acquired immediately after startup (T0), and the last sample in the sequence, H_08, was collected 7,316 s (≈ 122 min) after T0. A negative linear trend can be seen (grey 95% CI shown): FLH values are highest at the beginning of the session and decline as the instrument continues to run, with several late measurements approaching zero or slightly negative values."

NDRE is analogous to NDVI but replaces the red band (~665 nm) with a red-edge band (typically ~705 nm): The advantage is reduced saturation at high biomass. Around 665 nm, chlorophyll-a absorption quickly reaches an asymptote, so reflectance in the red band changes little as biomass increases and NDVI tends to plateau. In the red-edge region, however, reflectance remains sensitive: as biomass/chlorophyll increases, reflectance near ~705 nm continues to decrease (with a concomitant shift of the red-edge to longer wavelengths). Consequently, NDRE preserves sensitivity in dense canopies and correlates more strongly with biomass than NDVI, resulting with an R² square slightly higher than for the NDVI (R²_NDVI = 0.65, R²_NDRE = 0.67)… -_-’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Relationship between the NDRE, the NDVI and the dry weight of seagrasses measured in area H"

For each core (colored by site), we show Shannon diversity (H′), species richness (S), and Pielou evenness (J′). Metrics were computed from species‐level counts; H′ uses natural logarithms and J′ = H′/ln(S). Lines run from 0 to the core’s value and points mark the estimate; cores with no identified bivalves appear with H′ = 0 and J′ = 0. Hover to see exact values.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 shows per-core diversity for the two areas. Each dot is a core (colored by site) and panels display Shannon diversity (H′), species richness (S), and Pielou evenness (J′). Cores from area H generally sit higher for H′ and S, with less separation for J′.\nBayesian comparisons (reported as H–L) back this up. Shannon diversity is higher in H: mean difference +0.365 with a 95% credible interval [0.155, 0.579] and \\(P(H\\!-\\!L&gt;0)=1.00\\). Very little posterior mass falls within a small ±0.10 ROPE, so the increase is not only credible but also practically meaningful. Richness is also higher in H: +1.23 species on average, 95% CrI [0.17, 2.31], \\(P&gt;0=0.988\\). About one-third of the posterior lies within a ±1 species ROPE, suggesting a positive but modest gain in the number of species per core. For evenness, the difference is small and uncertain: +0.116, 95% CrI [−0.020, 0.247], \\(P&gt;0=0.956\\), with ~15% of the posterior inside a ±0.05 ROPE.\nOverall, area H hosts richer and more diverse bivalve assemblages than area L, while evenness is at most slightly higher in H and may be similar between areas."
